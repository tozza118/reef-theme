      "For three years the answers lived in a private repository. Every time a client asked why a page felt slow, or why we refused to add a fifth typeface, the reasoning was already written down somewhere. Publishing those notes cost us nothing and saved the same explanation twice a month.",
      "Reef Notes is that repository, cleaned up. Some entries are build logs with numbers in them, some are arguments about type, some cover the unglamorous half of freelancing: scoping, quoting, being paid on time. All of them come out of work we actually did.",
