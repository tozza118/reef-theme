# Working in Reef, as an agent

Reef is a free Astro theme, published under the MIT licence. The whole
community reads the source; every file you touch is part of the product.
This page is the operating manual. The five rule
files below are LOADED into context by the @ syntax rather than merely
cited: a rule an agent has to decide to go and open is a rule a hurried
agent skips.

@docs/conventions/astro.md
@docs/conventions/tailwind.md
@docs/conventions/typescript.md
@docs/conventions/motion.md
@docs/conventions/seo.md

In order: pure .astro and platform first; the token contract and what markup
may write; strict types, selfchecks and derived types; the animation ladder
and reduced motion; BaseHead, the JSON-LD constructors and the endpoints.

**Climb this ladder before you add anything.** It is the operating form of the
refusals in docs/design.md, and it is five questions, in this order. Does the
page need it at all, or is it there to look busy? Does it already exist under
src/components/ui, where sixty-four primitives are waiting? Can the platform do
it with no script, which is the house default and not an aspiration: a native
dialog, details, radio inputs with :has(), scroll-snap, a scroll timeline, an
anchor? Can CSS alone do it? Only then is it written, and what gets written is
the smallest version that works and that you can explain. Removing a section is
a better answer than tuning it, and a shape a reader already knows beats a
shape that is interesting to build.

What none of that excuses: understanding the problem before touching it,
validating anything that crosses a boundary, the error path, and
accessibility. Those are never the place to be economical.

Two things carry the rest of the context. The review checklist at the end
of docs/design.md, which you run on your own work before calling it done.
And the wiki in wiki/, which explains how each subsystem actually works:
start with wiki/overview.md, and add a sync entry there after a structural
change.

## What this theme is

A blog, free, in English and in French: a home that leads with the latest
piece, a paginated blog, topic and author pages, a reading column, and a
per-language RSS feed. The content is three Astro content collections (posts,
authors, topics) with zod schemas. There is no shop, no pricing, no CMS and no
server. The demo publication is fictional and named **Reef Notes**; the theme
is named **Reef**. A user replaces Reef Notes and keeps Reef.

## Stack

Astro 7 (static output, no adapter), Tailwind CSS 4 (CSS-first config, no
tailwind.config.js), tailwind-variants, @astrojs/mdx (Markdown and MDX posts)
and @astrojs/sitemap, Fontsource for Space Grotesk and Instrument Sans (the
only two fonts: the accent word keeps the heading font under a turquoise wave
underline). Node >= 22.18, pnpm. Demo copy is bilingual, for a fictional
publication named Reef Notes.

**No React, no WebGL, no animation library.** Reef has zero islands and nine
runtime dependencies. Every effect on the page is CSS. Adding a framework to
this repo is a design failure, not a feature.

## Structure

```text
src/
  components/
    Sections/   24 sections (Home/, Post/, Archive/, Search/, Global/, Legal/)
    svg/icons/  60 original icons, name union derived from icons.ts
    ui/         36 primitive families, see ui/README.md (the contract)
  config/       siteData, navData, legalData; types in config/types/
  content.config.ts  the posts, authors and topics collections, zod schemas
  data/         posts/ (Markdown/MDX), authors/ and topics/ (JSON), en/ + fr/
  i18n/         config, helpers, and the en/ + fr/ dictionaries
  js/           pure logic + selfchecks (schema, pagination, textUtils)
  layouts/      BaseLayout (html shell) and BaseHead (the whole <head>)
  pages/        [...locale]/{index,blog,topics,authors,about,contact,legal},
                404, robots, llms, rss
  styles/       tokens.css (design system), global.css, prose.css, motion/
scripts/        og.mjs (OG cards), rebrand.mjs (repaint), app.mjs (Capacitor)
wiki/           the maintained knowledge base
```

Import through aliases (tsconfig.json): @components/*, @config/*,
@layouts/*, @styles/*, @js/*, @i18n.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # dev server
pnpm build      # static build into dist/ (55 pages when green)
pnpm preview    # serve dist/
pnpm check      # astro check; must be 0/0/0 before you finish
pnpm rebrand "#7a59ff"   # repaint tokens.css from one brand color
pnpm og         # regenerate public/og/*.png from the tokens
pnpm poster     # re-shoot the phone mockup of the home page into public/

pnpm test       # every *.selfcheck.ts and *.test.ts under src/, found by name
pnpm lint:house # the four mechanical rules of this page, with their exemptions
pnpm verify     # the render bench: Playwright over dist/ at 390, 768, 1440
```

**What each check does NOT see.** This matters more than the list above,
because it is what stops "the build is green" from being mistaken for "the
work is done".

- `pnpm build` does not type-check. A green build with a broken type is normal.
- `pnpm check` types `.astro` and `.ts` but never EXECUTES a line, so a
  selfcheck it type-checks can still be failing.
- `pnpm test` runs pure logic. It has never seen a pixel.
- `pnpm lint:house` counts lines and characters. It cannot tell whether a
  header comment is TRUE, only that one is present.
- `pnpm verify` measures what was painted: overflow, clipped content, ink
  collisions, contrast, touch targets, heading order, alt text. It cannot
  measure taste. Hierarchy, balance and rhythm stay the review checklist at the
  end of docs/design.md, run by a human. It also declares contrast
  UNMEASURABLE over a background image rather than inventing a number.
- `pnpm poster` is not a check, it is a chore with a deadline: the phone
  mockup of the home page holds a SCREENSHOT, so it goes stale the moment the
  brand, the hero copy or the first screen changes. Re-run it after
  `pnpm rebrand` and after any redesign of the first screen, or the frame
  will keep showing the demo to a buyer who has already replaced it.
- Nothing here opens the site in a real browser on a real phone. The two worst
  defects of 31 August 2026 were both found by a human on an iPhone, and both
  are now covered by `pnpm verify`. The next one will not be.

## Non-negotiable conventions

1. Every file starts with a one-line comment: its path and its role.
2. No file exceeds 400 lines.
3. No em dashes, no en dashes, anywhere: code, comments, copy, docs. Plain
   hyphens only.
4. Header comments and code comments are in English. Displayed copy is in the
   dictionary and never in a component.
5. Markup uses semantic tokens only (bg-background, text-foreground, bg-card,
   bg-primary, text-muted-foreground, border-border, bg-surface, text-accent,
   text-accent-text, ring-ring). Palette names (ink-*, coral-*, reef-*) and
   raw hex never leave src/styles.
6. Zero JavaScript by default. Native `<dialog>`, `<details>`, anchors and
   CSS before any `<script>`. There is no React and no island in this theme.
7. Buttons are pills (rounded-pill). Cards float (bg-card rounded-card
   shadow-float). Sections breathe (py-24 md:py-32). Exactly one accent-script
   word per big title: it keeps the heading font, turns the house turquoise and
   carries the turquoise wave underline (--accent-wave). Coral is the second
   accent, rationed. Never an italic serif.
8. Single English locale: `export const getStaticPaths = localePaths;` on
   every page under [...locale]/, every internal href through `localizePath()`.
9. Accessibility is part of done: 44px touch targets, correct aria, alt
   everywhere, visible focus, reduced motion respected at both layers.
10. New third-party anything (package, font, asset) gets a THIRD-PARTY.md
    entry in the same change. Photos and icon libraries do not enter at all.
11. NO DECORATIVE PILL, ANYWHERE. A small rounded, translucent label that
    carries one word and does nothing - a topic, a category, a reference - is
    a template tic, not information. It almost always repeats what the title,
    the section eyebrow or the copy already says, and it pushes what the
    reader came for further down the page. `rounded-pill` stays the shape of
    BUTTONS, FIELDS and the topic chips, which are real links; an overline is
    written in small spaced capitals, the way SectionHeader writes its own.
    The test: if the element is neither clickable nor fillable, it takes no
    pill, and a pill that says what its neighbour says is removed rather than
    restyled. House rule of 5 September 2026: the "A la une" label left
    Cards/FeaturedPostCard.astro that day, because the section eyebrow above
    the card already said it. The author card's post count stays: a counter is
    not a label.

## Gotchas that have already bitten

- View transitions re-run nothing: a naive inline script executes once and
  dies on the next navigation. Use the established patterns (re-init on
  astro:page-load with a data-*-ready guard, document-level delegation, or
  astro:after-swap for `<html>` state). See docs/conventions/astro.md.
- astro:after-swap replaces `<html>` attributes with server-rendered ones;
  ThemeInit re-applies .dark for that reason. Do not "simplify" it away.
- assetsInlineLimit: 0 in astro.config.mjs is load-bearing (scripts must
  stay addressable across view transitions). Leave it.
- Tailwind 4 has no config file. New tokens go in tokens.css; new utilities
  are declared with @utility (see src/styles/motion). Do not create
  tailwind.config.js; do not use @apply with palette names.
- The `dark:` variant is bound to the .dark class via @custom-variant in
  global.css. Components written with semantic roles rarely need `dark:` at
  all; needing it for a color role means the token layer is the fix.
- **The theme does NOT follow the system colour scheme.** ThemeInit reads
  `localStorage` (key "reef-theme") and falls back to light, on purpose: most
  visitors prefer light, and a stored choice always wins. A screenshot in dark
  mode needs the key set to `dark` before first paint.
- trailingSlash is "always": internal hrefs end with /, and paginated list
  URLs come from the pagination helper (src/js/pagination.ts), not string
  concatenation.
- The scroll-driven utilities (animate-scroll-*) need their local
  reduced-motion guard because view() timelines ignore the global collapse.
  Never strip the double @media/@supports nesting in motion/scroll.css.
- The contact form (contact.astro) ships with no `action`, on purpose.
  Wiring it to an endpoint is the user's documented decision, not a fix.
- Draft posts build (for preview) but must stay out of lists, RSS and
  llms.txt: filter with data.draft !== true, like the existing readers.

## Definition of done

`pnpm check` at 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints, `pnpm build` green with 55
pages, the selfchecks passing, no em dash anywhere, no file over 400 lines,
the review checklist at the end of docs/design.md passed (or you fixed
what it found), and if the change was structural, the wiki got a sync
entry. Then, and only then, the task is finished.

## The design doctrine

Before adding a section, a colour, a typeface or an effect, read
docs/design.md. It is the house position: what it refuses, what it does
instead, and why. The checklist at the end of that file is run before every
release.
